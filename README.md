# Advanced DOM – Bankist Marketing Website

This project is a practice implementation of interactive DOM features for a fictional bank called **Bankist**.  
It’s part of the [complete-javascript-course](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-javascript-course) by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy.

## Project Overview

The **Bankist** marketing site demonstrates many advanced DOM manipulation techniques using JavaScript, including:

- Modal window (popup)
- Smooth scrolling navigation
- Sticky navigation bar
- Section reveal on scroll (fade-in effect)
- Lazy loading of images
- Tabbed component
- Menu fade animation on hover
- Slider/carousel component


## Features

- **Modal popup** – Opens and closes with multiple buttons.
- **Sticky Navbar** – Navigation stays at the top when scrolling.
- **Smooth Scrolling** – Navigation and button scroll smoothly to sections.
- **Section Reveal** – Sections fade in as you scroll down.
- **Lazy Image Loading** – Images load only when needed for better performance.
- **Tabbed Component** – Modern tabbed interface for content switching.
- **Menu Fade Animation** – Fades menu items on hover for a modern look.
- **Slider/Carousel** – Click arrows or dots to cycle through slides.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Start coding JavaScript in `script.js` (all effects are implemented here).
4. Practice and experiment with DOM methods and event listeners.
